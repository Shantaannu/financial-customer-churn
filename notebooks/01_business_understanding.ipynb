    "Key business realities:\n",
    "- Acquiring a new customer is significantly more expensive than retaining an existing one (The Amount Spend on Adv, Existing Customer Knows about the product so retaining Them is Easy Rather than Spendind Amount on Advertisement For New Customer)\n",
    "- Churned customers represent both revenue loss and wasted acquisition cost (Acqusition Cost Includes Marketing spend (ads, promotions, referral incentives), Sales teams efforts, Platform fees (Google Ads, affiliates, partnerships))\n",
    "- Early identification of churn risk allows proactive retention strategies\n"
